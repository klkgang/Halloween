# Halloween

This is one of my first projects coded in html, css and javascript. It's a simple game for the spooky season.
and it works by first letting the user see a screen with a button that says "try your luck" and then
the user can get 3 different results

-A good result called "sweet" which is the good result where the user
a screen appears that says "you have a candy"

-The second result is the "trick" this result writes in the
The user displays the message "I'm looking at you" with a cool typewriter effect.

-The third possible result is the "screamer", this result will wait 2 seconds and then put a
creepy photo of a gost on the screen (you can easily put the image you want and you can also add a sound with the image)
