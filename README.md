# Halloween
============================================= DESCRIPTION ============================================================
This is one of my first projects coded in html, css and javascript. It's a simple game for the spooky season.
and it works by first letting the user see a screen with a button that says "try your luck" and then
the user can get 3 different results

-The fisrt result called "sweet" which is the good result where the user
a screen appears that says "you got a candy"

-The second result is the "dulce" this result writes in the
The user displays the message "I'm watching at you" with a cool typewriter effect.

-The third possible result is the "screamer", this result will wait 2 seconds and then put a
creepy photo of a gost on the screen (you can easily put the image you want and you can also add a sound with the image)

============================================================ HISTORY ===================================================
I had the idea of this project because we are in spooky season so i wanted to make a game to share with my friends 
so since I'm in a AP cumputers science class I decided to used the html,css and javascript I been getting.
========================================================================================================================


======================================================== HOW WAS IT MADE ================================================
To make the main logic I used javascript, I used a swich case stament to in base the result the funcion "suerte" return
the program take the user to one page or another, then I just made the other pages and added the details using css.
=========================================================================================================================

====================================================== GOAL OF THE PROJECT ===============================================
My goal was to practice and to share a base for the community that everyone could use for their own projects.
